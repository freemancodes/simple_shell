## Overview

This is a Simple_Shell Collaborative Project written in C Language. It is one of the many hand-on-deck project instituted in the ALX_2022 Software Engineering Program meant to equip African Teck enthusiasts with the requisite Software Development skills that adresses most 21s century ITC challenges both industry and personal development wise.

The shell is the Linux command line interpreter. It provides an interface between the user and the kernel and executes programs called commands. For example, if user enters ``ls`` then the shell command should execute such command.

### Core Objectives
This project aims at providing an indepth understanding of the following;

1 - Who designed and implemented the original Unix operating system.

2 - Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell.

3 - Who invented the B programming language. (the direct predecessor to the C programming language)

4 - Who is Ken Thompson.

5 - How does a shell work.

6 - What is a pid and a ppid.

7 - How to manipulate the environment of the current process.

8 - What is the difference between a function and a system call.

9 - How to create processes.

10 - What are the three prototypes of main.

11 - How does the shell use the PATH to find the programs.

12 - How to execute another program with the execve system call.

13 - How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates.

14 - What is EOF / “end-of-file”?.

OUTPUT The program has the exact same output as sh (/bin/sh) as well as the exact same error output. Where the program prints an error, the name of the program is equivalent to argv[0]

### Requirements
	- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
	- All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options ``-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
	- Betty coding style is followed.
	- The simple shell has no known memory leaks.

### Bugs
No bugs has been found within the program as of this writing
